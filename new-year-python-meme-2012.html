<p>This series, also known as &#8220;<a href="http://ziade.org">Tarek Ziadé</a> strikes
again&#8221;, is a good occasion to take a look back at 2012 and see what I&#8217;ve
done related to python. So, let&#8217;s&nbsp;try.</p>
<p><strong>1. What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you
have discovered in 2012&nbsp;?</strong></p>
<p>I discovered
<a href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/docs/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a>
this year and quite enjoyed it. I like the way they bring back some nice
concepts on the table, and how they compete with other frameworks.
That&#8217;s nicely decomposed and everything fits together really well. I
learned a bit about its internal routing mechanism when working on
<a href="http://cornice.rtfd.org">Cornice</a>, and it&#8217;s really well&nbsp;done.</p>
<p><strong>2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012&nbsp;?</strong></p>
<p>I learned about asynchronous programming, something I wasn&#8217;t really
aware of. (Yes, that&#8217;s a shame). This was really helpful to understand
some bits of <a href="http://circus.io">Circus</a>. I also started to learn about
some related concepts present in <a href="http://golang.org">go</a> or in
<a href="http://erlang.org">erlang</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">the actor&nbsp;model</a></p>
<p><strong>3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012 ?
What did you do&nbsp;?</strong></p>
<p>I worked a bunch on <a href="http://cornice.rtfd.org">Cornice</a> and
<a href="http://circus.io">Circus</a>, not as much as I would like, but that was
two really interesting projects. For Cornice, I completely <a href="http://blog.notmyidea.org/refactoring-cornice.html">refactored
the internals</a> back
in May, and since that, I added support for
<a href="https://github.com/SPORE/specifications"><span class="caps">SPORE</span></a> and am currently
working on porting it to Python 3 and adding support for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/"><span class="caps">CORS</span></a>. For Circus, I worked on the web
interface and on other bits of the projects related to&nbsp;stats.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t contributed that much to <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a>,
mainly because I&#8217;m less excited about it than I was previously: the
project is working and needs to focus more on code quality than
features. We started in this direction, hopefully it will pay-off; but I
committed a lot less code than&nbsp;previously.</p>
<p><strong>4. Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012&nbsp;?</strong></p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t know. I found some interesting python-related news on
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">hacker news</a> and on the printed version
as well, <a href="http://hackermonthly.com/">hacker monthly</a>. Twitter and <span class="caps">IRC</span>
got me some interesting articles as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013&nbsp;?</strong></p>
<p>On the computer science side, I want to learn more about other
paradigms, maybe in other languages. I like python, but I want to learn
about other concepts, maybe some of them don&#8217;t really fit with&nbsp;python.</p>
<p>For instance, I don&#8217;t know that much about pattern matching or about the
actor model. Well I know what it is, but I would like to make good use
of them in order to have something nice and&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>Also, I want to learn how to make a product. From scratch. Which means
designing, implementing and maintaining something. Maybe this will be
the case with <a href="https://github.com/spiral-project/daybed">daybed</a> ? Who&nbsp;knows.</p>
<p>I want to get better at building communities. Working with others is
something that can be complex and quite hard sometimes. I want to learn
how to handle this&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>On the other side, I want to learn about tons of other non-tech things:
taking pictures, finding a good balance between life and work, working
with children, teaching and animating workshops, writing articles, be
better at reading (being critic when I&#8217;m&nbsp;thinking!).</p>
<p><strong>6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone
would write in 2013&nbsp;?</strong></p>
<p>The one missing thing, <span class="caps">IMO</span>, is a <strong>good</strong> webmail reader, in python. One
we could contribute to, one we could write features for, and one that
could come and compete with gmail, in term of features of <span class="caps">UI</span>.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, I&#8217;m just impressed by the new ideas that come
from others. I would like to have a library to handle the actor model in
a nice way in Python, I would like to see packaging fixed in python&nbsp;:-)</p>
