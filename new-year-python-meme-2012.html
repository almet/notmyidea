<p>This series, also known as "<a href="http://ziade.org">Tarek Ziadé</a> strikes
again", is a good occasion to take a look back at 2012 and see what I've
done related to python. So, let's try.</p>
<p><strong>1. What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you
have discovered in 2012 ?</strong></p>
<p>I discovered
<a href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/docs/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a>
this year and quite enjoyed it. I like the way they bring back some nice
concepts on the table, and how they compete with other frameworks.
That's nicely decomposed and everything fits together really well. I
learned a bit about its internal routing mechanism when working on
<a href="http://cornice.rtfd.org">Cornice</a>, and it's really well done.</p>
<p><strong>2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012 ?</strong></p>
<p>I learned about asynchronous programming, something I wasn't really
aware of. (Yes, that's a shame). This was really helpful to understand
some bits of <a href="http://circus.io">Circus</a>. I also started to learn about
some related concepts present in <a href="http://golang.org">go</a> or in
<a href="http://erlang.org">erlang</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">the actor
model</a></p>
<p><strong>3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012 ?
What did you do ?</strong></p>
<p>I worked a bunch on <a href="http://cornice.rtfd.org">Cornice</a> and
<a href="http://circus.io">Circus</a>, not as much as I would like, but that was
two really interesting projects. For Cornice, I completely <a href="http://blog.notmyidea.org/refactoring-cornice.html">refactored
the internals</a> back
in May, and since that, I added support for
<a href="https://github.com/SPORE/specifications">SPORE</a> and am currently
working on porting it to Python 3 and adding support for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a>. For Circus, I worked on the web
interface and on other bits of the projects related to stats.</p>
<p>I didn't contributed that much to <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a>,
mainly because I'm less excited about it than I was previously: the
project is working and needs to focus more on code quality than
features. We started in this direction, hopefully it will pay-off; but I
committed a lot less code than previously.</p>
<p><strong>4. Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012 ?</strong></p>
<p>I really don't know. I found some interesting python-related news on
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">hacker news</a> and on the printed version
as well, <a href="http://hackermonthly.com/">hacker monthly</a>. Twitter and IRC
got me some interesting articles as well.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013 ?</strong></p>
<p>On the computer science side, I want to learn more about other
paradigms, maybe in other languages. I like python, but I want to learn
about other concepts, maybe some of them don't really fit with python.</p>
<p>For instance, I don't know that much about pattern matching or about the
actor model. Well I know what it is, but I would like to make good use
of them in order to have something nice and useful.</p>
<p>Also, I want to learn how to make a product. From scratch. Which means
designing, implementing and maintaining something. Maybe this will be
the case with <a href="https://github.com/spiral-project/daybed">daybed</a> ? Who
knows.</p>
<p>I want to get better at building communities. Working with others is
something that can be complex and quite hard sometimes. I want to learn
how to handle this better.</p>
<p>On the other side, I want to learn about tons of other non-tech things:
taking pictures, finding a good balance between life and work, working
with children, teaching and animating workshops, writing articles, be
better at reading (being critic when I'm thinking!).</p>
<p><strong>6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone
would write in 2013 ?</strong></p>
<p>The one missing thing, IMO, is a <strong>good</strong> webmail reader, in python. One
we could contribute to, one we could write features for, and one that
could come and compete with gmail, in term of features of UI.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, I'm just impressed by the new ideas that come
from others. I would like to have a library to handle the actor model in
a nice way in Python, I would like to see packaging fixed in python :-)</p>
