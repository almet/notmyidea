    <h1>ðŸŒŸ</h1>
    <p>This series, also known as &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://ziade.org">Tarek ZiadÃ©</a> strikes again&quot;,
is a good occasion to take a look back at 2012 and see what I've done related
to python. So, let's try.</p>
<p><strong>1. Whatâ€™s the coolest Python application, framework or library you have
discovered in 2012 ?</strong></p>
<p>I discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/docs/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a> this year and
quite enjoyed it. I like the way they bring back some nice concepts on the
table, and how they compete with other frameworks. That's nicely decomposed and
everything fits together really well. I learned a bit about its internal
routing mechanism when working on <a class="reference external" href="http://cornice.rtfd.org">Cornice</a>, and
it's really well done.</p>
<p><strong>2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012 ?</strong></p>
<p>I learned about asynchronous programming, something I wasn't really aware of.
(Yes, that's a shame). This was really helpful to understand some bits of
<a class="reference external" href="http://circus.io">Circus</a>. I also started to learn about some related
concepts present in <a class="reference external" href="http://golang.org">go</a> or in <a class="reference external" href="http://erlang.org">erlang</a> with <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">the actor model</a></p>
<p><strong>3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012 ? What did
you do ?</strong></p>
<p>I worked a bunch on <a class="reference external" href="http://cornice.rtfd.org">Cornice</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://circus.io">Circus</a>, not as much as I would like, but that was two really
interesting projects. For Cornice, I completely <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.notmyidea.org/refactoring-cornice.html">refactored the internals</a> back in May, and since
that, I added support for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SPORE/specifications">SPORE</a>
and am currently working on porting it to Python 3 and adding support for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a>. For Circus, I worked on the web interface and
on other bits of the projects related to stats.</p>
<p>I didn't contributed that much to <a class="reference external" href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a>, mainly
because I'm less excited about it than I was previously: the project is
working and needs to focus more on code quality than features. We started in
this direction, hopefully it will pay-off; but I committed a lot less code than
previously.</p>
<p><strong>4. Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012 ?</strong></p>
<p>I really don't know. I found some interesting python-related news on <a class="reference external" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">hacker
news</a> and on the printed version as well,
<a class="reference external" href="http://hackermonthly.com/">hacker monthly</a>. Twitter and IRC got me some
interesting articles as well.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013 ?</strong></p>
<p>On the computer science side, I want to learn more about other paradigms, maybe
in other languages. I like python, but I want to learn about other concepts,
maybe some of them don't really fit with python.</p>
<p>For instance, I don't know that much about pattern matching or about the actor
model. Well I know what it is, but I would like to make good use of them in
order to have something nice and useful.</p>
<p>Also, I want to learn how to make a product. From scratch. Which means
designing, implementing and maintaining something. Maybe this will be the case
with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/spiral-project/daybed">daybed</a> ? Who knows.</p>
<p>I want to get better at building communities. Working with others is something
that can be complex and quite hard sometimes. I want to learn how to handle
this better.</p>
<p>On the other side, I want to learn about tons of other non-tech things: taking
pictures, finding a good balance between life and work, working with children,
teaching and animating workshops, writing articles, be better at reading (being
critic when I'm thinking!).</p>
<p><strong>6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would
write in 2013 ?</strong></p>
<p>The one missing thing, IMO, is a <strong>good</strong> webmail reader, in python. One we
could contribute to, one we could write features for, and one that could come
and compete with gmail, in term of features of UI.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, I'm just impressed by the new ideas that come from
others. I would like to have a library to handle the actor model in a nice way
in Python, I would like to see packaging fixed in python :-)</p>
