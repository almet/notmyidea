Help me to go to the distutils2 paris' sprint
#############################################

There will be a distutils2 sprint from the 27th to the 30th of january, thanks
to logilab which will host the event.

You can find more informations about the sprint on the wiki page of the event
(http://wiki.python.org/moin/Distutils/SprintParis).

I really want to go there but I'm unfortunately blocked in UK for money reasons.
The cheapest two ways I've found is about £80, which I can't afford. 
Following some advices on #distutils, I've set up a ChipIn account for that, so 
if some people want to help me making it to go there, they can give me some
money that way.

I'll probably work on the installer (to support old distutils and
setuptools distributions) and on the uninstaller (depending on the first
task). If I can't make it to paris, I'll hang around on IRC to give some help
while needed.

If you want to contribute some money to help me go there, feel free to use this

Thanks for your support !
