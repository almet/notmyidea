:description: or why I like opensource so much

Back in October, I released `pelican <http://docs.notmyidea.org/alexis/pelican>`_, 
a little piece of code I wrote to power this weblog. I had simple needs: I wanted
to be able to use my text editor of choice (vim), a vcs (mercurial) and
restructured text. I started to write a really simple blog engine
in something like a hundred python lines and released it on github.

And people started contributing. I wasn't at all expecting to see people
interested in such a little piece of code, but it turned out that they were.
I refactored the code to make it evolve a bit more by two times and eventually,
in 9 months, got 49 forks, 139 issues and 73 pull requests.

**Which is clearly awesome.**

I pulled features such as translations, tag
clouds, integration with different services such as twitter or piwik, import
from dotclear and rss, fixed
a number of mistakes and improved a lot the codebase. This was a proof that
there is a bunch of people that are willing to make better softwares just for 
the sake of fun.

Thank you, guys, you're why I like open source so much.
