    <p>I do have a problem with&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>You know. I <strong>have</strong> to check my emails, irc, twitter, my feed reader
etc. I need&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>And this thing makes me feel uncomfortable at the end of the day,
because I feel that I missed something. That I missed some good time,
away from news and&nbsp;agitation.</p>
<p>Working remotely is sometimes hard. Hard because you need to at the same
time be in the discussions channels and work on the interesting
projects. A real&nbsp;myth.</p>
<p>In practice, I&#8217;m really bad at multi-tasking. I tried a few times the
<em>Pomodoro</em> technique, which forces me to focus on a task for 25mn, but
this split of my day into slices of 25mn breaks my natural&nbsp;flow.</p>
<p>So, what do I need? I tried to change my tools, it helped a bit. Still,
I&#8217;m not focused like I would like to&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s just me who needs some more persuasion over myself, but the
best way I found to work is to unplug the cable. Literally. At work, at
some point I was using a <span class="caps">RJ45</span> cable to connect to the Internet. When I
wanted to work on something, I could just unplug this&nbsp;cable.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s amazing how you find yourself in the process to &#8220;check&#8221;
something on the web. Mails, irc… well, you got the idea. You&#8217;re
litterally, without even noticing, switching to your browser an opening
a new&nbsp;tab…</p>
<p>Of course, that Web isn&#8217;t filled only with lolcats and twitter messages
(even if I would <strong>love</strong> to see a pie chart with the repartition of
lolcats <span class="caps">VS</span> the rest of the web&#8217;s content), so sometimes you need some
precious bit of information that&#8217;s there. Fair enough. plug the cable,
do what you <strong>need</strong> to do, and unplug. Alexis,&nbsp;unplug!</p>
<p>It also helps to have some fair bit of documentation available directly
on my machine (I used to have the python docs, I should get it&nbsp;back!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling adventurous, so I&#8217;ll try something new starting tomorrow,
and I&#8217;ll report back in here my findings. Here&#8217;s the&nbsp;challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check emails only once a day</strong>. Do <strong>not</strong> do it in the morning,
    before working, to keep my mind clear. I would say at 2pm (after
    lunch). (This doesn&#8217;t mean I will not send mails&nbsp;tho)</li>
<li>Stay away from the Internet during the morning. I&#8217;ll not connect if
    I don&#8217;t need&nbsp;to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how it goes&nbsp;:)</p>
