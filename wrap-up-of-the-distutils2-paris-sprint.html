<p>Finally, thanks to a bunch of people that helped me to pay my train and
bus tickets, I&#8217;ve made it to paris for the distutils2&nbsp;sprint.</p>
<p>They have been a bit more than 10 people to come during the sprint, and
it was very productive. Here&#8217;s a taste of what we&#8217;ve been working&nbsp;on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the datafiles, a way to specify and to handle the installation of
    files which are not python-related (pictures, manpages and so&nbsp;on).</li>
<li>mkgcfg, a tool to help you to create a setup.cfg in minutes (and
    with funny&nbsp;examples)</li>
<li>converters from setup.py scripts. We do now have a piece of code
    which reads your current setup.py file and fill in some fields in
    the setup.cfg for&nbsp;you.</li>
<li>a compatibility layer for distutils1, so it can read the setup.cfg
    you will wrote for distutils2&nbsp;:-)</li>
<li>the uninstaller, so it&#8217;s now possible to uninstall what have been
    installed by distutils2 (see <span class="caps">PEP</span>&nbsp;376)</li>
<li>the installer, and the setuptools compatibility layer, which will
    allow you to rely on setuptools&#8217; based distributions (and there are
    plenty of&nbsp;them!)</li>
<li>The compilers, so they are more flexible than they were. Since
    that&#8217;s an obscure part of the code for distutils2 commiters (it
    comes directly from the distutils1 ages), having some guys who
    understood the problematics here was a&nbsp;must.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people have also tried to port their packaging from distutils1 to
distutils2. They have spotted a number of bugs and made some
improvements to the code, to make it more friendly to&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really pleased to see how newcomers went trough the code, and
started hacking so fast. I must say it wasn&#8217;t the case when we started
to work on distutils1 so that&#8217;s a very good point: people now can hack
the code quicker than they could&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>Some of the features here are not <em>completely</em> finished yet, but are on
the tubes, and will be ready for a release (hopefully) at the end of the&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>Big thanks to logilab for hosting (and sponsoring my train ticket) and
providing us food, and to bearstech for providing some money for
breakfast and&nbsp;bears^Wbeers.</p>
<p>Again, a big thanks to all the people who gave me money to pay the
transport, I really wasn&#8217;t expecting such thing to happen&nbsp;:-)</p>
