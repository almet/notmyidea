<p>Yesterday, as I was traveling to Tours, I&#8217;ve took some time to visit
Éric, another student who&#8217;s working on distutils2 this summer, as a
part of the GSoC. Basically, it was to take a drink, discuss a bit about
distutils2, our respective tasks and general feelings, and to put a face
on a pseudonym. I&#8217;d really enjoyed this time, because Éric knows a lot
of things about mercurial and python good practices, and I&#8217;m eager to
learn about those. So, we have discussed about things, have not wrote so
much code, but have some things to propose so far, about documentation,
and I also provides here some bribes of conversations we&nbsp;had.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>While writing the PyPI simple index crawler documentation, I realized
that we miss some structure, or how-to about the documentation. Yep, you
read well. We lack documentation on how to make documentation. Heh.
We&#8217;re missing some rules to follow, and this lead to a not-so-structured
final documentation. We probably target three type of publics, and we
can split the documentation regarding&nbsp;those:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packagers</strong> who want to distribute their&nbsp;softwares.</li>
<li><strong>End users</strong> who need to understand how to use end user commands,
    like the&nbsp;installer/uninstaller</li>
<li><strong>packaging coders</strong> who <em>use</em> distutils2, as a base for building a
    package&nbsp;manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need to discuss about a pattern to follow while writing
documentation. How many parts do we need ? Where to put the <span class="caps">API</span>
description ? etc. That&#8217;s maybe seems to be not so important, but I
guess the readers would appreciate to have the same structure all along
distutils2&nbsp;documentation.</p>
<h2 id="mercurial">Mercurial</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m really <em>not</em> a mercurial power user. I use it on daily basis, but I
lack of basic knowledge about it. Big thanks Éric for sharing yours with
me, you&#8217;re of a great help. We have talked about some mercurial
extensions that seems to make the life simpler, while used the right
way. I&#8217;ve not used them so far, so consider this as a personal&nbsp;note.</p>
<ul>
<li>hg histedit, to edit the&nbsp;history</li>
<li>hg crecord, to select the changes to&nbsp;commit</li>
</ul>
<p>We have spent some time to review a merge I made sunday, to re-merge it,
and commit the changes as a new changeset. Awesome. These things make me
say I <strong>need</strong> to read <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/">the hg book</a>,
and will do as soon as I got some spare time: mercurial seems to be
simply great. So &#8230; Great. I&#8217;m a powerful merger now&nbsp;!</p>
<h2 id="on-using-tools">On using&nbsp;tools</h2>
<p>Because we <em>also</em> are <em>hackers</em>, we have shared a bit our ways to code,
the tools we use, etc. Both of us were using vim, and I&#8217;ve discovered
vimdiff and hgtk, which will completely change the way I navigate into
the mercurial history. We aren&#8217;t &#8220;power users&#8221;, so we have learned from
each other about vim tips. You can find <a href="http://github.com/ametaireau/dotfiles">my dotfiles on
github</a>, if it could help.
They&#8217;re not perfect, and not intended to be, because changing all the
time, as I learn. Don&#8217;t hesitate to have a look, and to propose
enhancements if you have&nbsp;!</p>
<h2 id="on-being-pythonic">On being&nbsp;pythonic</h2>
<p>My background as an old Java user disserves me so far, as the paradigms
are not the same while coding in python. Hard to find the more pythonic
way to do, and sometimes hard to unlearn my way to think about software
engineering. Well, it seems that the only solution is to read code, and
to re-read import this from times to times ! <a href="http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html">Coding like a
pythonista</a>
seems to be a must-read, so, I know what to&nbsp;do.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It was really great. Next time, we&#8217;ll need to focus a bit more on
distutils2, and to have a bullet list of things to do, but days like
this one are opportunities to catch ! We&#8217;ll probably do another sprint
in a few weeks, stay tuned&nbsp;!</p>
