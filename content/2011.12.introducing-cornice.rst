Introducing Cornice
###################

Wow, already my third working day at Mozilla. Since Monday, I've been working with
`Tarek Ziad√© <http://ziade.org>`_, on a pyramid REST-ish toolkit named `Cornice <https://github.com/mozilla-services/cornice>`_.

Its goal is to take care for you of what you're usually missing so you can
focus on what's important. Cornice provides you facilities
for validation of any kind.

The goal is to simplify your work, but we don't want to reinvent the wheel, so
it is easily pluggable with validations frameworks, such as `Colander
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/colander/en/latest/>`_.

Handling errors and validation
==============================

Here is how it works:

.. code-block:: python

    service = Service(name="service", path="/service")


    def is_awesome(request):
        if not 'awesome' in request.GET:
            request.errors.add('query', 'awesome',
                                'the awesome parameter is required')


    @service.get(validator=is_awesome)
    def get1(request):
        return {"test": "yay!"}


All the errors collected during the validation process, or after, are collected
before returning the request. If any, a error 400 is fired up, with the list of
problems encountered returned as a nice json list response (we plan to support
multiple formats in the future)

As you might have seen, `request.errors.add` takes three parameters: **location**,
**name** and **description**.

**location** is where the error is located in the request. It can either be "body",
"query", "headers" or "path". **name** is the name of the variable causing
problem, if any, and **description** contains a more detailed message.

Let's run this simple service and send some queries to it::

    $ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:5000/service
    > GET /service HTTP/1.1
    > Host: 127.0.0.1:5000
    > Accept: */*
    >
    * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
    < HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request
    < Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
    [{"location": "query", "name": "awesome", "description": "You lack awesomeness!"}

I've removed the extra clutter from the curl's output, but you got the general idea.

The content returned is in JSON, and I know exactly what I have to do: add an
"awesome" parameter in my query. Let's do it again::

    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/service?awesome=yeah
    {"test": "yay!"}

Validators can also convert parts of the request and store the converted value
in `request.validated`. It is a standard dict automatically attached to the
requests.

For instance, in our validator, we can chose to validate the parameter passed
and use it in the body of the webservice:

.. code-block:: python

    service = Service(name="service", path="/service")


    def is_awesome(request):
        if not 'awesome' in request.GET:
            request.errors.add('query', 'awesome',
                                'the awesome parameter is required')
        else:
            request.validated['awesome'] = 'awesome ' + request.GET['awesome']


    @service.get(validator=is_awesome)
    def get1(request):
        return {"test": request.validated['awesome']}

The output would look like this:

::

    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/service?awesome=yeah
    {"test": "awesome yeah"}



Dealing with "Accept" headers
=============================

The HTTP spec defines a **Accept** header the client can send so the response
is encoded the right way. A resource, available at an URL, can be available in
different formats. This is especially true for web services.

Cornice can help you dealing with this. The services you define can tell which
`Content-Type` values they can deal with and this will be checked against the
**Accept** headers sent by the client.

Let's refine a bit our previous example, by specifying which content-types are
supported, using the `accept` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

    @service.get(validator=is_awesome, accept=("application/json", "text/json"))
    def get1(request):
        return {"test": "yay!"}

Now, if you specifically ask for XML, Cornice will throw a 406 with the list of
accepted `Content-Type` values::

    $ curl -vH "Accept: application/xml" http://127.0.0.1:5000/service
    > GET /service HTTP/1.1
    > Host: 127.0.0.1:5000
    > Accept: application/xml
    >
    < HTTP/1.0 406 Not Acceptable
    < Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
    < Content-Length: 33
    <
    ["application/json", "text/json"]


Building your documentation automatically
=========================================

writing documentation for web services can be painful, especially when your
services evolve. Cornice provides a sphinx directive to automatically document
your API in your docs.

.. code-block:: rst

    .. services::
       :package: coolapp
       :service: quote

Here is an example of what a generated page looks like: http://packages.python.org/cornice/exampledoc.html


Yay! How can I get it?
======================

We just cut a 0.4 release, so it's available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cornice
You can install it easily using `pip`, for instance::

    $ pip install cornice

You can also have a look at the documentation at
http://packages.python.org/cornice/

What's next?
============

We try to make our best to find how Cornice can help you build better
web services. Cool features we want for the future include the automatic
publication of a static definition of the services, so it can be used by clients
to discover services in a nice way.

Of course, we are open to all your ideas and patches! If you feel haskish and
want to see the sources, `go grab them on github <https://github.com/mozilla-services/cornice>`_
, commit and send us a pull request!
