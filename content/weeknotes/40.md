# Weeknotes #40

## What happened

Dangerzone:

- We had to publish an emergency 0.7.1 release, to account for Docker Desktop changes happening on Windows and MacOS. They changed how they generate IDs for their images, and this made the application fail to find them.
- We finished the move the Github Actions, adding some cache along the way. The outcome is faster tests and CI: it now takes 8 minutes to test run all the tests, build the artifacts, on all our supported platforms! 🙌🏼

## Takeaways

- It was pleasant to do this release without too much pressure, and it's nice to see we are paving the way for more automation in the future, which should release the stress even more ;
- I found myself emotionally triggered, a kind of traumatic backfire. It makes me realize I am in a posture now to let things go. It's crazy to see the amount of time required to recover from double cross, and to measure the impacts of it on my day to day life one year and half later 😬
- 🎺🎷🥁📣 Fortunately, music is here once again. Very happy to find a refuge here, with simple moments of joy.

## Sharing

- I'm starting to read « Comme un empire dans un empire » d'Alice Zeniter, and I like the writing so far. Let's see how it goes.
- I went to a gig of [Fleuves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKqsBx7-ZdE), it was nice to meet with friends there and feel the urge for dancing, and lose myself there 🕺🏼
- I went to see [Tatami](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatami_(film%2C_2023)) on the movies, the history of two judoca women participating to the judo championships for the islamic nation of Iran. A thriller, by all means, in black and white, where we can really feel the injustice. Powerful.

> **The gap between your abilities and your taste is not a gap to be crossed but one to be cultivated**. As you build your craft [...] you develop ever more ideas about what’s possible in your work. As your skill grows, so too do your ambitions, such that your taste always and forever outstrips your abilities. For every increment of improvement, you extend your desires out that much further. This is not to say you will never be satisfied with your work — although, that is a not uncommon scenario, and not necessarily as dreary as it sounds. But rather that as you become more capable, you are wont to find as much joy and satisfaction in the process of developing your skill as in the outcomes of it. **The work of creativity, at the end of the day, is the work of creativity — not what you create, but who you become in the act of creation**.
