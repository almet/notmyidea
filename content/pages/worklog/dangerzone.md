## Jeudi 30 Mai 2024 (8h, 4/5)

- Reproducing the currently failing CI issues locally and finding out that it might be related to the way the inner image current state, as it seems to not contain the pymupdf python module.
- 1:1 with Harris
- Dangerzone biweekly meeting w/ erik, alex and harris.

## Mercredi 28 Mai 2024 (9h, 5/5)

- While trying to install the `rpm` files generated by a_rpygio, I finally found out that the silicon m1 machine I'm using isn't fit for the job, as it's currently hitting some bugs when running "podman in docker", with rosetta enabled on the host. I created an issue on the repository about this: https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/824
- I've switched to my linux amd64 machine, and was able to install the dangerzone dev environment there, and test that the rpms are working great. I've validated the pending pull request by a_rpygio accordingly.
- I'm currently following-up on the python 3.9 version bump, as the produced `.deb` packages don't seem to work properly. I'm currently trying to reproduce the issue locally, with the hopes of fixing it tomorrow.


## Mardi 28 Mai 2024 (6h, 5/5)

- Learned how Debian python packaging works, and specifics of how `stdeb` does it.
- Reviewed PRs by AlexP about 
	- A 1:1 with AlexP where we discussed both the release process for fedora and debian packages, what are the specificities on how we're doing the signing etc.
- Took another approach for supporting the latest pyside6 version on debian + from sources.
- Started testing the new `rpms` that were uploaded by AlexP. Been caught on the silicon architecture differences, and started making changes in the current scripts for it to work.

## Lundi 27 Mai 2024 (7h, 4/5)

- Created PGP keys for `alexis@freedom.press` and setup github to work with it.
- Synced 1:1 with AlexP
- Got a better understanding of how containers work on different OSes, what's the role of hyperkit, etc.
- Triggered Debian builds on my machine, and continued the deep dive in Debian packages and stdeb to fix #780 (to have pyside6 newer versions work on our releases).

## Vendredi 24 Mai 2024 (5h, 5/5)

- Completed the Sexual Harassment NYC training, and forms. I was pretty surprised by the (good) quality of it, actually.
- Reviewed alex.p PR on the gVisor design document.
- Read the currently opened pull requests.
- build: bumped the minimum python version to 3.9 (in a PR)

## Jeudi 23 Mai 2024 (8h, 5/5)

- Read on how Dangerzone is currently being integrated in the tails docs, yay!
- Synced this morning with Alex, and discussed about how containerization works, and what's the difference between OSes.
- Split my "small changes" pull request in two parts, with minor changes on one side, and changes on how test fixtures are run on the other side.
- Spent some time with Alex understanding why the tests weren't working anymore, and we found that the current tests weren't using the proper fixtures. That was fun and instructive: I'm happy to have a better understanding of how the test suite works, and interacts with QT apps.
- Read the gVisor documentation Alex wrote. Learned about secomp filters.
- Started using the devscripts to install the different environments locally, and started to install a X11 server on OSX to have the application show up... to be continued tomorrow.

## Mercredi 22 Mai 2024 (8h, 5/5)

What I did today (a lot of reading, some meetings):

- Read a bunch of issues to better understand the packaging status of dangerzone. Notes for myself:
	- [Debian discussion](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=986856#29), how it works [on arch](), the goal to [have a small image for tails](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/669) (and in general, I guess)
	- The [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org), I was looking for resources on how to package on different targets, but didn't encounter this.
- Read the documentation of [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), and [the presentation](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/files/13821818/Considering.PyMuPDF-1.pdf) that was made for DangerZone (found out about [dangerzone-test-set](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone-test-set))
- Read on the difference between podman and Docker, I'm still lagging on this front, as I'm not a user myself.
- Read the different Pull Requests on the repository to get a grasp of what is currently going on. (I learned about MacOS [entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements) and more specifically [App Sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox))
- Read the [security audit](https://freedom.press/news/dangerzone-receives-favorable-audit/) for dangerzone (and the OWASP [Docker security cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) that was linked there)
- Looked at the dangerzone redesign documents from superbloom, both for the application and for the website. Nice work :-)
- Read the current code and made [a PR with minor changes](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/pull/811), and currently trying to setup my machine to work the same way Circle CI does.
- Did the security 101 presentation with Davis and David
- Welcome meeting with Erik, Harris and Alex.p


## Mardi 21 Mai 2024 (9h, 5/5)

- I'm looking at the current codebase and current infrastructure. I'm installing a development environment locally (using `uv`)
- I'm discovering how everything is structured. I find out about [yum-tools-prod](https://github.com/freedomofpress/yum-tools-prod) and [apt-tools-prod](https://github.com/freedomofpress/apt-tools-prod)
- I'm reading the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/freedomofpress/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It's nice to see this is though of, and well phrased.
- I'm reading the [meeting notes](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/wiki/Meeting-Notes) and clicked on some issues to see what's worked-on at the moment ([Explore how to Simplify Save Options · Issue #427 · freedomofpress/dangerzone · GitHub](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/427))
