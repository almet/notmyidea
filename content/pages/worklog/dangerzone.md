## Jeudi 17 Octobre 2024 (8h, 5/5)

Merge-day today :-)

- We finally merged the on-host conversion PR! Good work by A_pyrgio on this one. Happy to have it incorporated in time for the 0.8.0 release in the next few weeks: https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/pull/748
- Automating the closing of stale issues with the `needs info` tag after some inactivity: https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/pull/955
- Rebased and merged a PR catching installation errors (and other podman/docker errors) and displaying them in the UI to help gather feedback from users when things go wrong: https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/pull/952
- Small reviews: https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/pull/958.
- Rebased the PR adding a `--debug` flag to `dangerzone-cli`. Running with gVisor in debug mode seem to block, not sure if it's related to the on-host conversion or some work I did in there. Will investigate later on.
- Investigated the signing situation on Windows
- Did some more investigation on the relationship between App Armor and flags passed to the container runtime. Commented about that on https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/865
- Biweekly meeting, planning for 0.8.0 release and discussions on indep. container updates / container signing.

## Jeudi 10 Octobre 2024 (9h, 5/5)

I continued to work on adding tests for the container installation failure, and it turns out I want to do it in two ways: 1) check that errors are displayed when `.install()` returns `False` or raises an exception and 2) check that return values are what they should be.

Then, we debugged why colima isn't working on MacOS, and it turns out to be apparmor-related. We found out that dangerzone was working with an older colima version, where the VM was using alpine, and not ubuntu, so no apparmor in there. We proposed a solution to the user. It was a productive session.

We continued discussing a bit with Alex on different matters, and one of them was about how to use the python's `logging` utility while in the imports. We finally decided the added complexity to handle this right wasn't worth the added value of it.

I also attended Giulio "braindump" session, where he explained how TUF and Sigstore work. My takeaway is that TUF can be seen as a kind of framework to decide how to validate new certs, and how to make it possible for the end users to have some sort of canary: if there are no updates, there is a problem somehow.

Sigstore is basically a way to a) have a proof that you are the owner of a {Google, Github} account, issuing certificates for this and b) sign and publish information related to artifacts you want to publish. There is an observatory inside it, to publish what's going on, following the same principles as Google CT for TLS certificates.
## Mercredi 09 Octobre 2024 (8h, 5/5)

I've reviewed the work done by Alex on the on host conversion, which spawned some interesting discussions about how to deal with our scripts generally speaking, covered by [#946](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/946) . I tested the branch locally on a M1 mac and it works well 🎉

I've updated the Github issue templates with the review, and we should be good soon there.

Also, I spent some time mocking `subprocess.Popen`, to finally use `pytest-mockpopen` which does the heavy lifting for us (it's not working with the `unittest.mock` out of the box, unfortunately).

I sent and merged a quick PR replacing `set-output` by environment variables in our CI.

## Mardi 08 Octobre 2024 (6h, 5/5)

I started writing tests for the branch which checks the image installation. It seems that the best way forward will be to `@mock.patch` the calls to docker/podman, to see if the errors are displayed. I'm not really sure if I should consider this a unit test or a functional test (probably both ? 🤔).

What I want to test is:

- Are the logs generated by the calls to docker / podman present ?
- When clicking on retry, do the messages go away ?

I also started writing a blueprint of how the independent container updates might work, and what are the problems this will solve. I've started creating an API, but I stopped in the middle of it, wondering if it could make sense to use signing mechanisms from the registries, rather than doing it ourselves.

It's possible to do so [on podman at least](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/image_signing.md) ([another link](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/building_running_and_managing_containers/assembly_signing-container-images_building-running-and-managing-containers#proc_signing-container-images-with-gpg-signatures_assembly_signing-container-images)), but it requires some control on the receiving machine, which we might not have. See this: 

```
$ cat /etc/containers/policy.json
{
  ...
  "transports": {
    "docker": {
      "<registry>/<namespace>": [
        {
          "type": "signedBy",
          "keyType": "GPGKeys",
          "keyPath": "<path>/key.gpg"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

[Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo) is a tool to transport the containers from one machine to another, so it's something we might want to use, but it's not installable on windows unfortunately.

Started reviewing the onhost conversion PR Alex proposed. Will resume tomorrow on this.

I created an issue on the repository about this: https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/824
- I've switched to my linux amd64 machine, and was able to install the dangerzone dev environment there, and test that the rpms are working great. I've validated the pending pull request by a_rpygio accordingly.
- I'm currently following-up on the python 3.9 version bump, as the produced `.deb` packages don't seem to work properly. I'm currently trying to reproduce the issue locally, with the hopes of fixing it tomorrow.

- Synced this morning with Alex, and discussed about how containerization works, and what's the difference between OSes.
- Split my "small changes" pull request in two parts, with minor changes on one side, and changes on how test fixtures are run on the other side.
- Spent some time with Alex understanding why the tests weren't working anymore, and we found that the current tests weren't using the proper fixtures. That was fun and instructive: I'm happy to have a better understanding of how the test suite works, and interacts with QT apps.
- Read the gVisor documentation Alex wrote. Learned about secomp filters.
- Started using the devscripts to install the different environments locally, and started to install a X11 server on OSX to have the application show up... to be continued tomorrow.

## Mercredi 22 Mai 2024 (8h, 5/5)

What I did today (a lot of reading, some meetings):

- Read a bunch of issues to better understand the packaging status of dangerzone. Notes for myself:
	- [Debian discussion](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=986856#29), how it works [on arch](), the goal to [have a small image for tails](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/669) (and in general, I guess)
	- The [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org), I was looking for resources on how to package on different targets, but didn't encounter this.
- Read the documentation of [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), and [the presentation](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/files/13821818/Considering.PyMuPDF-1.pdf) that was made for DangerZone (found out about [dangerzone-test-set](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone-test-set))
- Read on the difference between podman and Docker, I'm still lagging on this front, as I'm not a user myself.
- Read the different Pull Requests on the repository to get a grasp of what is currently going on. (I learned about MacOS [entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements) and more specifically [App Sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox))
- Read the [security audit](https://freedom.press/news/dangerzone-receives-favorable-audit/) for dangerzone (and the OWASP [Docker security cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) that was linked there)
- Looked at the dangerzone redesign documents from superbloom, both for the application and for the website. Nice work :-)
- Read the current code and made [a PR with minor changes](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/pull/811), and currently trying to setup my machine to work the same way Circle CI does.
- Did the security 101 presentation with Davis and David
- Welcome meeting with Erik, Harris and Alex.p


## Mardi 21 Mai 2024 (9h, 5/5)

- I'm looking at the current codebase and current infrastructure. I'm installing a development environment locally (using `uv`)
- I'm discovering how everything is structured. I find out about [yum-tools-prod](https://github.com/freedomofpress/yum-tools-prod) and [apt-tools-prod](https://github.com/freedomofpress/apt-tools-prod)
- I'm reading the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/freedomofpress/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It's nice to see this is though of, and well phrased.
- I'm reading the [meeting notes](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/wiki/Meeting-Notes) and clicked on some issues to see what's worked-on at the moment ([Explore how to Simplify Save Options · Issue #427 · freedomofpress/dangerzone · GitHub](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/427))
