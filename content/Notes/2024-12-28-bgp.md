*These are notes taken during and after the 38C3 conference in Hambourg. Notes might be a bit sketchy at times*

I went to this session because I don't know anything about BGP and how it works. It was a bit hard to follow, but I got some knowledge out of it!

- The conversation on how to have BGP-enabled hackerspaces started a few years back at CCC
- Some people do this in Montreal, and in the Netherlands
- The more people do this, the easier it will be to reduce the friction.

- A `/32` block of IP adresses is worth 60k€ (!!)

In germany, there is Community AX which is here to connect non-profits together.

## Tools

- [bgp.tools](https://bgp.tools) where you can navigate the different AS. For instance [Labitat](https://bgp.tools/prefix/185.38.175.0/24#connectivity)
- Labitat, a hackerspace in Copenhagen is [documenting how they do it](https://labitat.dk/wiki/Labicolo)

## Ideas

If you want to do it, find some people and get an AS number. It is possible on a business address, and requires a phone number.

The cost is of 90€ immediatly + 60€/y to get an AS number. It's useful to connect with somebody directly.

Getting people working at ISPs helps a lot because they know how it works.

Connect with your local university, they might want to help you and sponsor the AS number.
