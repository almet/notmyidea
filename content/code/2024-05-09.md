I've [learned today](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/5-things-designers-can-do-with-javascript/) a really simple trick I wasn't aware of, to turn any webpage into something I can edit, I just need to enter:

```js
document.designMode = "on";
```

You can enter this directly in the console, or in the document directly. Very impressive when used on newspaper websites.
