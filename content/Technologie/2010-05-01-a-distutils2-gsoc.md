# A Distutils2 GSoC

WOW. I've been accepted to be a part of the [Google Summer Of
Code](http://code.google.com/intl/fr/soc/) program, and will work on
[python](http://python.org/) [distutils2](http://hg.python.org/distutils2/), with [a](http://pygsoc.wordpress.com/) [lot](http://konryd.blogspot.com/) [of](http://ziade.org/) (intersting !) [people](http://zubin71.wordpress.com/).

> So, it's about building the successor of Distutils2, ie. "the python
> package manager". Today, there is too many ways to package a python
> application (pip, setuptools, distribute, distutils, etc.) so there is
> a huge effort to make in order to make all this packaging stuff
> interoperable, as pointed out by
> the [PEP 376](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0376/).

In more details, I'm going to work on the Installer / Uninstaller features of Distutils2, and on a PyPI XML-RPC client for distutils2. Here are the already defined tasks:

  - Implement Distutils2 APIs described in PEP 376.
  - Add the uninstall command.
  - think about a basic installer / uninstaller script. (with deps) --
    similar to pip/easy\_install
  - in a pypi subpackage;
  - Integrate a module similar to setuptools' package\_index'
  - PyPI XML-RPC client for distutils 2:

As I'm relatively new to python, I'll need some extra work in order to apply all good practice, among other things that can make a developper-life joyful. I'll post here, each week, my advancement, and my tought about python and especialy python packaging world.
