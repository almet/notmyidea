<p><strong>Edit: Thanks to logilab and some amazing people, I can make it to
paris for the sprint. Many thanks to them for the support!</strong></p>
<p>There will be a distutils2 sprint from the 27th to the 30th of january,
thanks to logilab which will host the event.</p>
<p>You can find more informations about the sprint on the wiki page of the
event (<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/Distutils/SprintParis">http://wiki.python.org/moin/Distutils/SprintParis</a>).</p>
<p>I really want to go there but I'm unfortunately blocked in UK for money
reasons. The cheapest two ways I've found is about Â£80, which I can't
afford. Following some advices on #distutils, I've set up a ChipIn
account for that, so if some people want to help me making it to go
there, they can give me some money that way.</p>
<p>I'll probably work on the installer (to support old distutils and
setuptools distributions) and on the uninstaller (depending on the first
task). If I can't make it to paris, I'll hang around on IRC to give some
help while needed.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute some money to help me go there, feel free to
use this chipin page:

<p>Thanks for your support !</p>
