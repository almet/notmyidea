<p>At PyconFR, this week-end, a few ideas were thrown in the air and one of
them was to have a /dev/fort doing some python-related&nbsp;coding.</p>
<p>The concept of a /dev/fort is to put a bunch of hackers together and see
what comes out from it. Tarek is doing something related with the Afpy
Computer Camps at his house each year, I&#8217;ve been there twice and it
really was a nice&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>At Djangocong 2012, in Montpellier (south of France), <a href="http://blog.mathieu-leplatre.info/">Mathieu
Leplatre</a> and myself started to work
on a model validation and storage service, named
<a href="https://github.com/spiral-project/daybed/">Daybed</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked about this project to some persons this week-end (I&#8217;ve even
done <a href="http://alexis.notmyidea.org/lightning-daybed.html">a lightning
talk</a> about it) and
it gathered some interest from people in the python community, so we
thought about sprinting on&nbsp;this.</p>
<h2 id="20-and-21-october-a-computer-camp">20 and 21 October - A Computer Camp&nbsp;!</h2>
<p>Add to this a few beers, and the sprint turns magically into a camp.
We&#8217;ll be sprinting at the end of October (the 20 and 21) near Angers, on&nbsp;daybed.</p>
<p>We plan to have great food and wine, so if you feel like it and if you
want to come and work on some python-related things, you&#8217;re&nbsp;invited!</p>
<p>Although, I can host a limited number of persons, so you&#8217;ll need to
contact me before :), that&#8217;s alexis at notmyidea dot&nbsp;org.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve setup a wiki page to organize a bit everything (knowing how many
people will come by will allow me to handle things better), please put
information&nbsp;there:</p>
