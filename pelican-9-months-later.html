<p>Back in October, I released
<a href="http://docs.notmyidea.org/alexis/pelican">pelican</a>, a little piece of
code I wrote to power this weblog. I had simple needs: I wanted to be
able to use my text editor of choice (vim), a vcs (mercurial) and
restructured text. I started to write a really simple blog engine in
something like a hundred python lines and released it on&nbsp;github.</p>
<p>And people started contributing. I wasn&#8217;t at all expecting to see people
interested in such a little piece of code, but it turned out that they
were. I refactored the code to make it evolve a bit more by two times
and eventually, in 9 months, got 49 forks, 139 issues and 73 pull&nbsp;requests.</p>
<p><strong>Which is clearly&nbsp;awesome.</strong></p>
<p>I pulled features such as translations, tag clouds, integration with
different services such as twitter or piwik, import from dotclear and
rss, fixed a number of mistakes and improved a lot the codebase. This
was a proof that there is a bunch of people that are willing to make
better softwares just for the sake of&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>Thank you, guys, you&#8217;re why I like open source so&nbsp;much.</p>
