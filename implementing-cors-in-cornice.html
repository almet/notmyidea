Note

</div>

I&#8217;m cross-posting [on the mozilla services
weblog](https://blog.mozilla.org/services/). Since this is the first
time we&#8217;re doing that, I though it could be useful to point you there.
Check it out and expect more technical articles there in the future.

</div>

<p>For security reasons, it&#8217;s not possible to do cross-domain requests. In
other words, if you have a page served from the domain lolnet.org, it
will not be possible for it to get data from&nbsp;notmyidea.org.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s possible, using tricks and techniques like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP"><span class="caps">JSONP</span></a>, but that doesn&#8217;t work all
the time (see <a href="#how-this-is-different-from-jsonp">the section below</a>). I
remember myself doing some simple proxies on my domain server to be able
to query other&#8217;s <span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a nicer way to do this, namely, &#8220;Cross Origin
Resource-Sharing&#8221;, or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/"><span class="caps">CORS</span></a>.</p>
<h2 id="you-want-an-icecream-go-ask-your-dad-first">You want an icecream? Go ask your dad&nbsp;first.</h2>
<p>If you want to use <span class="caps">CORS</span>, you need the <span class="caps">API</span> you&#8217;re querying to support it;
on the server&nbsp;side.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">HTTP</span> server need to answer to the <span class="caps">OPTIONS</span> verb, and with the
appropriate response&nbsp;headers.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OPTIONS</span> is sent as what the authors of the spec call a &#8220;preflight
request&#8221;; just before doing a request to the <span class="caps">API</span>, the <em>User-Agent</em> (the
browser most of the time) asks the permission to the resource, with an
<span class="caps">OPTIONS</span>&nbsp;call.</p>
<p>The server answers, and tell what is available and what&nbsp;isn&#8217;t:</p>
<p><img alt="The CORS flow (from the HTML5 CORS tutorial)" src="images/cors_flow.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1a. The User-Agent, rather than doing the call directly, asks the
    server, the <span class="caps">API</span>, the permission to do the request. It does so with
    the following&nbsp;headers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access-Control-Request-Headers</strong>, contains the headers the
    User-Agent want to&nbsp;access.</li>
<li><strong>Access-Control-Request-Method</strong> contains the method the
    User-Agent want to&nbsp;access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>1b. The <span class="caps">API</span> answers what is&nbsp;authorized:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</strong> the origin that&#8217;s accepted. Can
    be * or the domain&nbsp;name.</li>
<li><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</strong> a <em>list</em> of allowed methods.
    This can be cached. Note than the request asks permission for
    one method and the server should return a list of accepted&nbsp;methods.</li>
<li><strong>Access-Allow-Headers</strong> a list of allowed headers, for all of
    the methods, since this can be cached as&nbsp;well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The User-Agent can do the &#8220;normal&#8221;&nbsp;request.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you want to access the /icecream resource, and do a <span class="caps">PUT</span> there,
you&#8217;ll have the following&nbsp;flow:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&gt; OPTIONS /icecream
&gt; Access-Control-Request-Methods = PUT
&gt; Origin: notmyidea.org
&lt; Access-Control-Allow-Origin = notmyidea.org
&lt; Access-Control-Allow-Methods = PUT,GET,DELETE
200 OK
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can see that we have an Origin Header in the request, as well as a
Access-Control-Request-Methods. We&#8217;re here asking if we have the right,
as notmyidea.org, to do a <span class="caps">PUT</span> request on&nbsp;/icecream.</p>
<p>And the server tells us that we can do that, as well as <span class="caps">GET</span> and <span class="caps">DELETE</span>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll not cover all the details of the <span class="caps">CORS</span> specification here, but bear
in mind than with <span class="caps">CORS</span>, you can control what are the authorized methods,
headers, origins, and if the client is allowed to send authentication
information or&nbsp;not.</p>
<h2 id="a-word-about-security">A word about&nbsp;security</h2>
<p><span class="caps">CORS</span> is not an answer for every cross-domain call you want to do,
because you need to control the service you want to call. For instance,
if you want to build a feed reader and access the feeds on different
domains, you can be pretty much sure that the servers will not implement
<span class="caps">CORS</span>, so you&#8217;ll need to write a proxy yourself, to provide&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Secondly, if misunderstood, <span class="caps">CORS</span> can be insecure, and cause problems.
Because the rules apply when a client wants to do a request to a server,
you need to be extra careful about who you&#8217;re&nbsp;authorizing.</p>
<p>An incorrectly secured <span class="caps">CORS</span> server can be accessed by a malicious client
very easily, bypassing network security. For instance, if you host a
server on an intranet that is only available from behind a <span class="caps">VPN</span> but
accepts every cross-origin call. A bad guy can inject javascript into
the browser of a user who has access to your protected server and make
calls to your service, which is probably not what you&nbsp;want.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-is-different-from-jsonp">How this is different from <span class="caps">JSONP</span>?</h2>
<p>You may know the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP"><span class="caps">JSONP</span></a> protocol.
<span class="caps">JSONP</span> allows cross origin, but for a particular use case, and does have
some drawbacks (for instance, it&#8217;s not possible to do DELETEs or PUTs
with <span class="caps">JSONP</span>).</p>
<p><span class="caps">JSONP</span> exploits the fact that it is possible to get information from
another domain when you are asking for javascript code, using the
\&lt;script> element.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exploiting the open policy for \&lt;script> elements, some pages use
them to retrieve JavaScript code that operates on dynamically
generated <span class="caps">JSON</span>-formatted data from other origins. This usage pattern
is known as <span class="caps">JSONP</span>. Requests for <span class="caps">JSONP</span> retrieve not <span class="caps">JSON</span>, but arbitrary
JavaScript code. They are evaluated by the JavaScript interpreter, not
parsed by a <span class="caps">JSON</span>&nbsp;parser.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="using-cors-in-cornice">Using <span class="caps">CORS</span> in&nbsp;Cornice</h2>
<p>Okay, things are hopefully clearer about <span class="caps">CORS</span>, let&#8217;s see how we
implemented it on the&nbsp;server-side.</p>
<p>Cornice is a toolkit that lets you define resources in python and takes
care of the heavy lifting for you, so I wanted it to take care of the
<span class="caps">CORS</span> support as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>In Cornice, you define a service like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">cornice</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Service</span>

<span class="n">foobar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Service</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;foobar&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/foobar&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># and then you do something with it</span>
<span class="nd">@foobar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_foobar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># do something with the request.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To add <span class="caps">CORS</span> support to this resource, you can go this way, with the
cors_origins&nbsp;parameter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">foobar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Service</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;foobar&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;/foobar&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cors_origins</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;*&#39;</span><span class="p">,))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Ta-da! You have enabled <span class="caps">CORS</span> for your service. <strong>Be aware that you&#8217;re
authorizing anyone to query your server, that may not be what you&nbsp;want.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, you can specify a list of origins you trust, and you don&#8217;t
need to stick with *, which means &#8220;authorize&nbsp;everyone&#8221;.</p>
<h3 id="headers">Headers</h3>
<p>You can define the headers you want to expose for the&nbsp;service:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">foobar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Service</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;foobar&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;/foobar&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cors_origins</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;*&#39;</span><span class="p">,))</span>

<span class="nd">@foobar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cors_headers</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;X-My-Header&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Content-Type&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_foobars_please</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;some foobar for you&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I&#8217;ve done some testing and it wasn&#8217;t working on Chrome because I wasn&#8217;t
handling the headers the right way (The missing one was Content-Type,
that Chrome was asking for). With my first version of the
implementation, I needed the service implementers to explicitely list
all the headers that should be exposed. While this improves security, it
can be frustrating while&nbsp;developing.</p>
<p>So I introduced an expose_all_headers flag, which is set to True by
default, if the service supports <span class="caps">CORS</span>.</p>
<h3 id="cookies-credentials">Cookies /&nbsp;Credentials</h3>
<p>By default, the requests you do to your <span class="caps">API</span> endpoint don&#8217;t include the
credential information for security reasons. If you really want to do
that, you need to enable it using the cors_credentials parameter. You
can activate this one on a per-service basis or on a per-method&nbsp;basis.</p>
<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>
<p>When you do a preflight request, the information returned by the server
can be cached by the User-Agent so that it&#8217;s not redone before each
actual&nbsp;call.</p>
<p>The caching period is defined by the server, using the
Access-Control-Max-Age header. You can configure this timing using the
cors_max_age&nbsp;parameter.</p>
<h3 id="simplifying-the-api">Simplifying the <span class="caps">API</span></h3>
<p>We have cors_headers, cors_enabled, cors_origins, cors_credentials,
cors_max_age, cors_expose_all_headers … a fair number of
parameters. If you want to have a specific <span class="caps">CORS</span>-policy for your
services, that can be a bit tedious to pass these to your services all
the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>I introduced another way to pass the <span class="caps">CORS</span> policy, so you can do
something like&nbsp;that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">policy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">enabled</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">False</span><span class="p">,</span>
              <span class="n">headers</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;X-My-Header&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Content-Type&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
              <span class="n">origins</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;*.notmyidea.org&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
              <span class="n">credentials</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">,</span>
              <span class="n">max_age</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">foobar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Service</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;foobar&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;/foobar&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cors_policy</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">policy</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="comparison-with-other-implementations">Comparison with other&nbsp;implementations</h2>
<p>I was curious to have a look at other implementations of <span class="caps">CORS</span>, in django
for instance, and I found <a href="https://gist.github.com/426829.js">a gist about
it</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, this adds a middleware that adds the &#8220;rights&#8221; headers to the
answer, depending on the&nbsp;request.</p>
<p>While this approach works, it&#8217;s not implementing the specification
completely. You need to add support for all the resources at&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>We can think about a nice way to implement this specifying a definition
of what&#8217;s supposed to be exposed via <span class="caps">CORS</span> and what shouldn&#8217;t directly in
your settings. In my opinion, <span class="caps">CORS</span> support should be handled at the
service definition level, except for the list of authorized hosts.
Otherwise, you don&#8217;t know exactly what&#8217;s going on when you look at the
definition of the&nbsp;service.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>There are a number of good resources that can be useful to you if you
want to either understand how <span class="caps">CORS</span> works, or if you want to implement it&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://enable-cors.org/">http://enable-cors.org/</a> is useful to get started when you don&#8217;t
    know anything about <span class="caps">CORS</span>.</li>
<li>There is a <span class="caps">W3C</span> wiki page containing information that may be useful
    about clients, common pitfalls etc:
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/CORS_Enabled">http://www.w3.org/wiki/CORS_Enabled</a></li>
<li><em><span class="caps">HTML5</span> rocks</em> has a tutorial explaining how to implement <span class="caps">CORS</span>, with
    <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-adding-cors-support-to-the-server">a nice section about the
    server-side</a>.</li>
<li>Be sure to have a look at the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=cors">clients support-matrix for this
    feature</a>.</li>
<li>About security, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/CrossOriginRequestSecurity">check out this&nbsp;page</a></li>
<li>If you want to have a look at the implementation code, check <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/cornice/pull/98/files">on&nbsp;github</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the <span class="caps">W3C</span> specification is the best resource to rely on. This
specification isn&#8217;t hard to read, so you may want to go through it.
Especially the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#resource-processing-model">&#8220;resource processing model&#8221;&nbsp;section</a></p>
